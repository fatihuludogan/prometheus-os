# prometheus-os

**prometheus** is operating system created for learning purposes and for fun. One of my goals when starting the project was to get my very old computer working again.

## Why and How to Build It?

As I said before, my main goal was to make new fun things on my old computer and have fun (sometimes it can be more annoying than fun), but I also wanted to keep myself busy, so I started. The project is not finished yet, it is still under development and I still have a long way to go. I had to learn and read a lot of things throughout the project, the resources I used for now are available below and I will share the roadmaps or mindmaps I have drawn at the end of the project.

A few sources I use:

- [Wiki OS Dev:](https://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page) Maybe I can say that it is the only source that can be enough to develop an OS in itself.

- [Broken Thorn:](http://www.brokenthorn.com/Resources/OSDevIndex.html) A very useful resource, especially when developing kernels and bootloaders.

- [littleosbook:](https://littleosbook.github.io/) Again, it is a good resource in the same way, I have followed it from time to time and I recommend it.

- Apart from these, there are also a few books that can be useful if you are a fan, I didn't make much use of books because my goal was not to develop a very large operating system, but when I searched, I heard that _Andrew S. Tanenbaum_'s books were useful.
